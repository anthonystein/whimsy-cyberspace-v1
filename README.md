# Whimsy Cyberspace

A deliberately minimal digital environment.

Whimsy Cyberspace is not a content site and not a portfolio.
It is a field containing a small number of authored objects:
fiction, non-fiction, and physical artifacts.

Each object exists as a room.
Each room can be entered, but not navigated traditionally.

---

## Structure

- **The Field**  
  A spatial interface where objects are weighted, not ordered.

- **Rooms**  
  Overlays that contain the work itself:
  - *The Infinite Hotel* — fiction as structure  
  - *Broadway* — a one-of-one physical artifact  
  - *Perspective Philosophy* — non-fiction distilled from lived writing

- **No feeds. No funnels.**  
  The site does not optimize for engagement or retention.

## Correspondence

Some rooms include a quiet form for release notifications.
One message when something becomes real.
Nothing else.

Email submissions are stored privately via a serverless backend.

---

## Technology

- Static site (HTML / CSS / Vanilla JS)
- Deployed via Vercel
- Source of truth: GitHub
- Email capture: Google Apps Script → Google Sheets

No frameworks. No trackers. No analytics.

---

## Authorship

All work is authored by David Bacchus.
The site is maintained as a living system, not a finished product.
